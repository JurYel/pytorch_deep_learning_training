# PyTorch Deep Learning Training

### Welcome to this Introductory Lecture on PyTorch Deep Learning

In this repository are the examples that were created in the four lectures we have covered, feel free to review these examples in this github repository.

In conclusion, this introductory lecture on PyTorch deep learning covered several fundamental topics. We began with an overview of PyTorch and its advantages in deep learning. We then moved on to discuss the basics of tensors, including how to create, manipulate, and index them. Next, we explored simple tensor operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as advanced tensor operations such as tensor products, tensor contractions, and tensor decomposition.

We also briefly discussed neural networks and the basics of backpropagation. Finally, we covered the fundamentals of matrix operations, including inversion, transpose, and determinant.

Overall, this lecture provided a strong foundation for anyone starting to learn PyTorch and deep learning. By mastering these concepts, you will be well-equipped to start building your own deep learning models and exploring more advanced topics in the field.

I hope you learned something in this introductory lecture of pytorch deep learning, thank you and God bless everyone!
